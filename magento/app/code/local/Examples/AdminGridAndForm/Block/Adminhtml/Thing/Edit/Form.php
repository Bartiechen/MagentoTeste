/**
 * Thing form
 *
 * This class gets instantiated by it's container, which is of type
 * {@link Examples_AdminGridAndForm_Block_Adminhtml_Thing_Edit}. This class is
 * responsible for creating the actual HTML form, with all the fieldsets and
 * inputs etc, so this is the actual <form></form> and everything in it
 *
 * What might not be obvious is that this form is used for both addition and
 * editing of whatever entity type it is you are working with. You won't get to
 * see this though as this relies on the controller registering certain data
 * so this form will act as though it is adding a new entity all the time,
 * whereas in reality you would code the controller to register some data to
 * allow it to work as an 'edit', rather than a 'new' form.
